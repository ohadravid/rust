explicit panic
stack backtrace:
panicked at $SRC_DIR_REAL/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs:LL:COL:
unsafe precondition(s) violated: slice::from_raw_parts requires the pointer to be aligned and non-null, and the total size of the slice not to exceed `isize::MAX`

This indicates a bug in the program. This Undefined Behavior check is optional, and cannot be relied on for safety.
thread panicked while processing panic. aborting.
